The Enhanced Lightbox is a jQuery plugin that allows designers and developers to overlay single images and/or image collections in a webpage, using very little extra markup. It is based on Leandro Vieira’s popular jQuery Lightbox 0.5, and available under a Creative Commons license (per imperative of the original script’s license).

Download the repository or go to http://www.eduardomorais.com/code/lightbox for the usage instructions and examples.
